; Learn more about the settings below at http://enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/config.htm
; Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition is best experienced in a 16:9 aspect ratio!

[Display]
; Detects every resolution your display offers and makes them selectable choices (along with showing their aspect ratios) in the game's Options > Advanced Options menu.
DynamicResolution = 1

; Forces the game window to be above all other windows, inlcuding the Start Menu bar. Note: Only works when playing in windowed mode.
ForceTopMost = 0

; Selecting the 60 FPS option will result in an overall smoother gameplay experience, while fixing many high framerate issues that would otherwise occur.
SetSixtyFPS = 1

; Creates a window border for the game. Only works when playing in windowed mode. Note: The game's windowed resolution must not be close to or exactly the same as your display's width and/or height, otherwise the border will not appear. This is a safety measure to ensure the border doesn't get lost outside of your display area.
WndModeBorder = 1

[Fullscreen Media]
; Adds compatibility for the project's Image Enhancement Pack to have its visuals display correctly. Must be enabled if using the Image Enhancement Pack. The scaling works for both the original and enhanced fullscreen images. Auto: Automatically chooses "fit" or "fill" depending on the aspect ratio for the best presentation. Fit: Displays the fullscreen images without any cropping. Letterboxes or pillarboxes may appear depending on the aspect ratio. Fill: Scales the fullscreen images to fill the display area, removing any letterboxes or pillarboxes, up to a 16:9 aspect ratio.
FullscreenImages = 3

; Adds compatibility for the project's FMV Enhancement Pack to have its videos display correctly. The scaling works for both the original and enhanced FMVs. Auto: Automatically chooses "fit" or "fill" depending on the aspect ratio for the best presentation. Fit: Displays the FMVs without any cropping. Letterboxes or pillarboxes may appear depending on the aspect ratio. Fill: Scales FMVs to fill the display area, removing any letterboxes or pillarboxes, up to a 16:9 aspect ratio.
FullscreenVideos = 3

; Enabling this feature sets the 2D, full screen images to their original aspect ratios, regardless of the aspect ratio used. This will remove stretching on the images when played in widescreen. Disabling this feature stretches the images to fit the screen. This affects all full screen images, such as the main menu, save screens, memo/riddle images, and inventory screen, along with other textures, such as subtitles and the flashlight lens glow. Note: Disabling this will override and also disable Fullscreen image scaling.
Fix2D = 1

; Choose to show or hide non-pre-rendered cutscene letterboxing. Set to "Auto" to enable the letterboxing on standard aspect ratios, and disable them on widescreen aspect ratios. Note: Non-pre-rendered cutscene letterboxing should be hidden or set to 'Auto' when playing in a widescreen aspect ratio and enabling cutscene FOV scaling. Otherwise, the letterboxing may crop off character heads when playing in widescreen. (Show = 0, Hide = 1, Auto = 3)
DisableCutsceneBorders = 3

; In-engine cutscenes will be zoomed in to match their original 4:3 horizontal compositions when playing in widescreen. This will hide "frozen" character models that have been loaded in, right outside the 4:3 boundaries, ready and waiting to enter the scene. Note: This feature will zoom up to a 16:9 aspect ratio. It will not zoom past this aspect ratio as too much of the vertical composition would be cropped otherwise. This means that ultra-wide aspect ratios will still see visual anomalies as in-engine cutscenes play out.
ReduceCutsceneFOV = 1

; Primarily fixes issues when viewing the map. This feature forces all dynamically made pillarboxing to be black in color, restores pillarboxing to events which did not have them, and hides map markings behind the pillarboxing.
SetBlackPillarBoxes = 1

[DirectX]
; Converts the game from DirectX 8 to DirectX 9, allowing for additional features and fixes to be used. Note: Must be enabled to use shaders below.
d3d8to9 = 1

; Determines how the game should collect the front buffer data used for fade outs and the pause screen. Note: DirectX will only work on your primary monitor. DirectX may be required when playing in fullscreen mode on certain older Windows operating systems. Linux only works with DirectX. It is recommended to keep this on "auto" unless you are experiencing visual issues with fade outs or the pause screen.
FrontBufferControl = 0

; Disables the Direct3D9 Maximized Windowed Mode feature on newer versions of Windows. Allows antialiasing to work in fullscreen mode. Requires running the game in DirectX 9 to work.
DisableMaximizedWindowedMode = 1

; Attempts to use the secondary dedicated display adapter on a laptop with more than one GPU (hybrid video cards). Requires running the game in DirectX 9 to work.
ForceHybridEnumeration = 1

[Shaders]
; Restores the ability to adjust the brightness level in the game's options menu, regardless if playing in windowed or fullscreen mode.
RestoreBrightnessSelector = 1

; Enables subpixel morphological anti-aliasing (SMAA). Note: It is recommended to disable this if using GPU-based anti-aliasing.
EnableSMAA = 0

; Enables shaders that simulate what the game would look like on a CRT television. These shaders look more accurate at lower resolutions. For the best CRT nostalgic experience, play the game in a 4:3 aspect ratio. Note: It is not recommended to enable this option if you are streaming the game, as the CRT effect may not display correctly to your viewers. It is also not recommended to enable this option if you have a low-end computer system.
CRTShader = 0

[Images]
; Allows higher quality, upscaled images to be used. Must be enabled if using the project's Image Enhancement Pack.
EnableTexAddrHack = 1

[Effects]
; Enables all advanced graphics settings from the game's Options > Advanced Options menu (complex fog, shadows, lens flare, etc) by default upon each game launch.
UseBestGraphics = 1

; Restores shadows and shadow behaviors throughout the game. This includes the use of soft shadows, correct shadow level intensities, accurate shadow fading on flashlight toggles, and the restoration of self shadows (shadows being casted upon dynamic objects such as items and characters).
EnableSoftShadows = 1

; Restores post-processing effects to their original intensities throughout the game. Effects include depth-of-field blur, motion blur, static blur, and pseudo blooms.
RestoreSpecialFX = 1

; Restores specularity and specular behavior throughout the game. This gives "shininess" to things such as character eyeballs, Red Pyramid Thing's helmet, Maria's skirt, and will make these things shine brighter whenever they're under a light source or when James' flashlight is on.
SpecularFix = 1

; Increases the front draw distance in certain areas to hide the environment loading in.
IncreaseDrawDistance = 1

; Increases the blood pool size of dead enemies back to their original amount.
IncreaseBlood = 1

; Restores the flashlight reflection on the town's shop windows at night. Also creates reflections on additional glass and glossy surfaces throughout the game. Note: The project's "Enhanced Edition Essential Files" package must be used in conjunction with this feature for the reflection to work.
FlashlightReflection = 1

; Improves the overall look and feel of the water effects used throughout the game.
WaterEnhancedRender = 1

[Noise Filter]
; Adjust the grain size of the noise filter.
IncreaseNoiseEffectRes = 768

; Restores the levels and opacity of the noise filter back to its original look.
PS2StyleNoiseFilter = 1

; Fixes an issue where the game would render the subtitles behind the noise grain during FMVs.
FmvSubtitlesNoiseFix = 1

[Fog]
; Restores the thickness, size, and amount of fog to its original look.
FogFix = 1

; Fixes an issue on Nvidia graphics cards where the 2D fog layer and the glow around James' flashlight did not render.
FogLayerFix = 1

; Adjusts the fog-of-war boundaries for specific areas to fix visual errors.
FogParameterFix = 1

; Adjusts the speed of the fog for slower, more natural movement to match its original behavior.
FogSpeedFix = 1

; Horizontally extends the fog at the beginning observation deck so that it always fills the screen, up to a 16:9 aspect ratio, for a better presentation. Note: Modified obGB.fcl file must be present in "sh2e\bg\ob\" for this feature to display properly.
ObservationDeckFogFix = 1

[Audio]
; Allows higher quality sound files to be used. Must be enabled if using the project's Audio Enhancement Pack.
EnableSFXAddrHack = 1

; Replaces the game's bugged CRIWARE streaming audio engine with a custom streaming audio engine solution. This fixes the infamous issue where the game's audio would glitch out and play an infinite one second loop, which would inevitably crash the game. This audio issue was the reason why the game would need to be ran on a single processor core prior to this fix. With this fix, the game can now run stable on multiple cores with overall performance improvements (such as less game stutters).
EnableCriWareReimplementation = 1

; Uses DSound-to-OpenAL and OpenAL Soft to emulate EAX for newer operating systems that don't support EAX. Enable this feature for 3D binaural audio for a more immersive experience.

FlashlightToggleSFX = 1

; Plays an alternate, cut audio track for the VHS tape FMV. We recommend to only enable this after beating the game at least once. Note: You must have the correct version of this FMV that contains both audio tracks. If you do not, then only the original audio will play. You can obtain the correct version of this FMV by downloading the project's FMV Enhancement Pack.
VHSAudioFix = 0

[Controller]
; Restores right joystick functionality for controllers to move the search camera around. Change the setting depending on what type of controller you are using. Note: If using Xidi (controller support software), set this option to "DirectInput".
RestoreSearchCamMovement = 2

; Movement Mode: The D-pad will act as an additional movement pad to control James and navigate menu selections. Button Mode: The D-pad will act as additional controller buttons, allowing you to assign game functions to the D-pad. You will NOT be able to control James or navigate menus with the D-pad. Hybrid Mode: The D-pad will act as additional controller buttons, allowing you to assign game functions to the D-pad. You will NOT be able to control James but WILL be able to navigate menus with the D-pad.

AutoUpdateModule = 1

; Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition will read and use files in the "sh2e" folder, rather than the "data" folder, whenever possible. This allows custom, modified game files to be stored in the "sh2e" folder so as not to replace/overwrite original game files, which are found in the "data" folder. Any game files which have not been modified for the project will still be read from the "data" folder like normal, so you must keep the "data" folder and leave it untouched. Note: If disabled, various other features will also be disabled. This feature should never be disabled.
UseCustomModFolder = 1

; Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition will read and use fonts and language files in the "lang" folder, rather than the "data" or "sh2e" folders, whenever possible. This allows custom language files to replace/overwrite original game files. Note: requires "Use custom 'sh2e' folder" to be enabled.
